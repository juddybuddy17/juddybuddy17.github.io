									<a href="https://github.com/juddybuddy17/MLB-Odds-Predictor" class="image fit"><img src="images/download.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I've pioneered an innovative approach to Major League Baseball (MLB) predictions, harnessing the power of intricate machine learning models meticulously trained on comprehensive game statistics spanning the last 33 years. Drawing on my experience as a former collegiate middle-infielder, I focused my statistical analysis predominantly on hitting data, complemented by pitching and defensive insights.

										Leveraging this extensive historical data, my models demonstrate exceptional proficiency in forecasting critical outcomes such as Run Differential, Total Runs, and predicting the favored winner in matchups between any two MLB teams. To bring this groundbreaking technology to the fingertips of baseball enthusiasts, I've meticulously crafted an intuitive Streamlit web application.
										
										This user-friendly app invites enthusiasts and analysts alike to effortlessly select their preferred Home and Away teams, embarking on a captivating exploration into the performance of my models. Whether you're a seasoned baseball aficionado or simply intrigued by the convergence of data science and sports analytics, my project offers a distinctive and insightful perspective into the dynamic world of MLB predictions. </p>

									<p>In this captivating project, I harnessed the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tackle the challenge of classifying subreddit posts, unraveling the cosmic battle between Star Wars and the magical world of Harry Potter. Armed with state-of-the-art machine learning models, I delved into the intricacies of fan discourse to discern the distinctive voices of these two passionate communities. To breathe life into this endeavor,I meticulously employed diverse preprocessing techniques, orchestrating a symphony of linguistic analysis. The transformative prowess of Count Vectorizer (Cvec) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Vectorizer (Tvec) became my artistic tools, reshaping raw textual data into nuanced representations. Cvec meticulously counted linguistic nuances, while Tvec weighed the significance of terms, unraveling the subtleties that distinguish one fandom from the other. Each model became a unique lens through which I navigated the vast galaxy of fan expression, uncovering patterns and subtleties that define the essence of Star Wars and Harry Potter enthusiasts. This project not only showcases the technical prowess of NLP models but also delves into the cultural tapestry woven by two of the most iconic fandoms in the universe. Join me on this journey of linguistic discovery and fandom exploration.</p>

									<p>Have you ever pondered the artistry behind setting the perfect selling price for a house? Join me on a captivating journey into the realm of real estate valuation through my participation in a Kaggle competition. In this project, I sought to unravel the intricate process that Realtors and sellers' agents employ to determine the optimal sell price for homes. I took the reins by selecting a myriad of housing features, each carefully chosen to mirror the considerations of a first-time homebuyer after that pivotal open house experience. These features became the palette for my predictive models, meticulously crafted to decode the nuances that contribute to the sell price of homes in Ames, Iowa. My journey didn't end with the training data; I ventured into uncharted territory by applying my models to an unseen test dataset, putting their predictive prowess to the ultimate test. This project not only showcases my technical proficiency in data analysis and machine learning but also offers a glimpse into the strategic decision-making process that shapes the real estate landscape. Step into the world of predictive analytics and uncover the secrets behind pricing homes, an endeavor that seamlessly blends data science with the nuanced art of real estate valuation.</p>
